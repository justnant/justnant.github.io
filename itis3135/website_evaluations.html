                <ul>

            <h3>Bad Website:</h3>
            <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">ebay</a>
            <p>eBay is an online marketplace where users can buy and sell products through auctions or direct purchases.</p>
            <div class="list-conatiner">
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: eBay’s site is visually cluttered with small text, overwhelming product listings, and excessive advertisements, making it difficult to focus.</li>
                    <li>Repitition: While branding and colors remain consistent, there is too much variation in text size, button styles, and layout.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The homepage and product pages feel cluttered with too many sections competing for attention, often making the alignment appear messy and inconsistent.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Too much information is crammed into a single page, making it difficult to scan and navigate effectively. </li>
