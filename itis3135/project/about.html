      <h2>About Balanced Bites</h2>
        <p><strong>Balanced Bites</strong> was founded to create a supportive space where individuals and families can learn to nourish their bodies with confidence. Backed by years of clinical experience,
           Roudayna built this platform to bridge the gap between science and everyday nutrition.</p>

      <h3>Meet Roudayna</h3>
        <p>Roudayna is a licensed nutritionist with a heart for helping people feel their best. She’s certified in holistic wellness, sustainable meal planning, and child nutrition—and she’s all about turning good science 
          into everyday habits that actually work.

          For Roudayna, nutrition isn’t just about what’s on your plate. It’s about creating simple, lasting routines that support your health and fit into your real life. She’s passionate about making wellness feel approachable,
           not overwhelming.</p>
          
        
    
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>We empower individuals and families with the knowledge and tools needed to make balanced nutritional choices every day.</p>
