              <strong>Files and Links:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>All links from the ITIS3135 page are working correctly.</li>
                <li>Internal header links navigate properly across pages.</li>
                <li>File and folder naming is consistent and clear.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Contrast:</strong> Overall contrast is good — the text stands out clearly against the background. No major readability issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Repetition:</strong> There's good repetition in font style and heading sizes, but some pages feel a little different in terms of spacing and layout. 
                  Try to make margins and padding more consistent across all pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Alignment:</strong> Content is mostly well-aligned, but some sections could benefit from slightly tighter alignment, especially form elements 
                  <strong>Proximity:</strong> Spacing between sections is solid. Elements are grouped well without feeling cramped.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Page Elements:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Each page includes a header, main, and footer, matching expected structure.</li>
                <li> Add a consistent page title inside the title tag (in the tab of the browser) that matches each page name. 
                  Right now, some pages have generic titles like "Document." A clear title helps users know where they are.</li>
                <li>
                  Also, consider adding a small logo or icon in the header to give the site a bit more branding.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Assignment Requirements:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Has five functional pages</li>
                <li>A home page named index.html</li>
                <li>A working and consistent nav bar</li>
                <li>4 other working pages with content for each</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Notes:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The form page is functional, but could be improved by adding "required" attributes to important fields (like name and email) to prevent empty submissions.
                <li>
                  The color scheme is simple but clean — you could spice it up with a few more hover effects (for example, buttons changing color slightly on hover).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overall, the website is nicely done — just minor polish and small enhancements (titles, form tweaks) would take it to the next level.
                </li>
